# MSBA, Loyola Marymount University

This is the final capstone project folder for Fandango Seat Anaytics. To create a framework to create analytical dataset and create explanatory and predicting model for predicting a seat popularity score in a movie auditorium. This involves feature creation from historical dataset provided by the client. There are two notebooks one for the creation of analytical dataset and other for the model creation

# Data Source
