#BSAN 6070 - Final Project

# Machine Learning Predictiion Algorithms to determine China's COVID 19 numbers

This project explores sevreal machine learning prediction models to determine the real numbers for China on COVID 19.
Models used in this notebook - Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor , K means clustering, LSTM.

# Data Source

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
These instructions apply for the python notebook.

# Prerequisites

1. A computer with Wi-Fi connection.

2. A web browser (any of your preference).

3. An account on Google-Drive.

4. Basic knowledgement in using computers, Internet and Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook.

# Running Instructions

User can download and run the .ipynb notebooks from the Final Project folder in the repository BSAN6070-CA-SAH.
Inline comments have been provided to explain the several sections of the code

# Steps

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Download the files attached to this repository.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to your Google Drive account.

3. In your Google Drive account, click in New -> More.. -> Google Colaboratory

4. In your new Google Colab file, go to File -> Open notebook

5. Upload the data file attached to this repository. The code should appear in the screen, with the corresponding outputs. This means that you don't need to run it

6. Make sure to upload all the datasets (csv files) as you will need to import them in the google colab or jupyter notebook
