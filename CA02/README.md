# CA02 

CA02_Mohu_Naive Bayes_Notebook.ipynb is a python 3.0 notebook program for spam email detection using Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm.

# Installation Instructions

User must have Jupyter notebook installed or Google Colab notebook Python 3.0 environment 
The libraries required for this code are as follows:

os

numpy

collections

sklearn.naive_bayes

sklearn.metrics 


# Running Instructions

User can download the .ipynb notebook from the repository. The data is stored in the Google Drive folder in the specified path under the 
TRAIN_DIR and TEST_DIR. If you get an error in file path run the code for mounting the google drive. 
Open the file and run each cell one by one. The output will take several minutes to show up, as the email folder size is big. 

# Usage

The code is provided with detailed comments and text columns to provide clear understanding of Naive Bayes model. The code is divided into three parts. 

1. Cleaning and Preparing the data 

2. Feature Extraction 

3. Running Naive Bayes model on training and test data
