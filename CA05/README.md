# CA05 A and B - Logitic Regression and KNN Algorithm

CA05A.ipynb and CA05B_Mohu.ipynb are a python 3.0 notebook program for building Logitic Regression models for predicting has cardiovascular diseases. CA05 B is a KNN algorithm for building a recommender system to recommend upto 5 movies matching with the input.

# Data Source 

CA05 A -  https://github.com/ArinB/CA05-B-Logistic-Regression/raw/master/cvd_data.csv 
Ca05 B - https://github.com/ArinB/CA05-kNN/raw/master/movies_recommendation_data.csv
# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. These instructions apply for the python notebook.

# Prerequisites

1. A computer with Wi-Fi connection.

2. A web browser (any of your preference).

3. An account on Google-Drive.

4. Basic knowledgement in using computers, Internet and Google Colaboratory.

# Running Instructions

User can download and run the .ipynb notebooks from the CA05 folder in the repository BSAN6070-CA-SAH.
Inline comments have been provided to explain the several sections of the code

# Steps

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Download the files attached to this repository.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to your Google Drive account.

3. In your Google Drive account, click in New -> More.. -> Google Colaboratory

4. In your new Google Colab file, go to File -> Open notebook

5. Upload the data file attached to this repository. The code should appear in the screen, with the corresponding outputs. This means that you don't need to run it
